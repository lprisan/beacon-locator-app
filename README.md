# classroom-tracker-app
A small Android application to track the location of a person in a classroom, using bluetooth beacons.

**For now, the app is built using Evothings Studio, not Cordova** -- This means shorter development cycles and refresh, but building the apk is too complex. To run it, just:

1. Clone the repo
2. Open Evothings Studio and go to My Apps
3. Drag the app's index.html there
4. In the Evothings Viewer app in your phone, connect to the workbench
5. In the Studio workbench, click on Run in your app (the UI should appear in your phone)

---

Later on, we should build the app/apk with Cordova, see https://evothings.com/doc/build/cordova-guide.html :


```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-file
cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-device-motion.git

(... add also the accelerometer and ibeacons plugins...)
```

This has two ways of working, to be set in the config.xml file:

... after building (```cordova build android```) and installing the application ipk in the phone...
* The phone is autonomous: 	```<content src="index.html" />```
* The application code is injected from the desktop IDE: ```<content src="http://myipaddress:4042" />```
   * Execute ```EvothingsWorkbench```, and drag and drop the index.html file to it
   * In the phone, start the app and connect to the IDE
   * In the IDE, click Run on the application row
